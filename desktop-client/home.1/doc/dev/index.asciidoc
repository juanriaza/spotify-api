Stuff to think about
--------------------

Loading
~~~~~~~
All data use for Home is fetched (undecorated) at startup and is then decorated
as the page renders.

The step function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The step function is basically a main view controller that controls the flow of
the entire page. It handles fallbacks for the different parts of the page.
Todo.

Dealing with ads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The most important thing is that that the MPU (mid page unit) never goes under
the fold. In the case of Whats new the MPU is located in the second section
next to the trending playlist container.

Example: +spotify:ad:1faeb27f84ed460897e21ad81a9fa69d+

There are also HPTOÂ´s (home page take over). Please make sure the sections are
flipped properly as the New Albums section should be placed under the HPTO
banner (it is the only section allowed layering over the HPTO).

Example: +spotify:ad:b9de55265d3d45078532fdc9c371350f+

Playlist and track lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The page will display the most relevant and available information to the user.
This is the track lists priority:

1.   Top tracks among friends
2.   Top tracks near you
3.   Top tracks in your country

The same goes for the playlist lists:

1.   Trending playlists among friends
2.   Top playlists near you
3.   Top tracks in your country

For instance, if no tracks are found among friends, it will move on and try to
use tracks near you.
